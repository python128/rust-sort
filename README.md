# rust-sort
A simple program to make a file of random float values, and arrange them.

## Why?
Just a simple project program...

## Extra:
- /tests are the tests made by me.
- /docs are where the ascending and descending files are stored. **They rewrite eveytime you run the program.**
- In /src, main.rs can be run using `cargo run`. A panic-ed help msg will be shown if you run it without args.
- To arrange, run `src/arrange <file to sort>`

## Extra extra: ;-)
- My test files are in a format:
	- t1(1) - shows the test number.
	- 100(2) - shows the amount of numbers.
	- 100(3) - is the range(eg 0..100)
	- eg: `t3-100-100.csv`
- run only in the **main directory.**
